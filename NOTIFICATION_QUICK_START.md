## Tips & Best Practices

### ✅ Do This
- Check notifications regularly to stay updated on user activity

- Delete old notifications to keep the dashboard clean
- Use notifications to identify urgent user requests

### ❌ Don't Do This
- Don't delete important notifications without reviewing them
- Don't ignore notification badges - they indicate pending actions
- Don't assume a notification is read just because you've seen it - click "Mark as Read"
