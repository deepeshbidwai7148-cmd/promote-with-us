        <h1>💰 Refund & Cancellation Policy</h1>
        <div class="last-updated">
            <strong>Company Name:</strong> Promote With Us<br>
            <strong>Last Updated:</strong> 28 January 2026
        </div>

        <p><strong>This policy outlines the refund and cancellation procedures at Promote With Us.</strong> We want to ensure transparency in our financial transactions. Please read this policy carefully to understand your rights and obligations regarding refunds and cancellations.</p>

        <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
        <p><strong>All payments are non-refundable once work has started.</strong> This policy protects both parties and ensures we can allocate resources efficiently.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #000000;">Refund Eligibility</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Before Work Commencement:</strong> If you cancel within 48 hours of payment and before any work has begun, you may be eligible for a full refund.</li>
            <li><strong>After Work Begins:</strong> Once our team has started working on your project (which includes project planning, design mockups, coding, content creation, or any service delivery), no refunds will be issued.</li>
            <li><strong>Partial Refunds:</strong> In exceptional circumstances (such as unforeseeable personal emergencies), partial refunds may be considered at Promote With Us's sole discretion.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #000000;">How to Request a Refund</h3>
        <p>To request a refund within the eligible period:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Send a written request to promotewithus6@gmail.com with your project details and order number</li>
            <li>Include your reason for the refund request</li>
            <li>Provide your original payment receipt or invoice number</li>
            <li>We will review your request and respond within 7-10 business days</li>
            <li>If approved, refunds are processed to your original payment method within 5-7 business days</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #000000;">Refund Processing Time</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bank Transfers:</strong> 5-7 business days</li>
            <li><strong>Online Payment Gateways:</strong> 3-5 business days</li>
            <li><strong>Note:</strong> Processing times may vary depending on your bank or payment provider</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cancellation Policy</h2>
        <p><strong>Project Cancellation Terms:</strong> If you cancel an ongoing project, specific financial and delivery terms apply.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #000000;">Advance Payment Non-Refund</h3>
        <p>The initial advance payment (typically 50% of project cost) is <strong>non-refundable</strong> regardless of when the project is cancelled. This payment secures your project slot and allows us to begin work immediately.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #000000;">Payment for Completed Work</h3>
        <p>You remain liable for payment of all work completed up to the cancellation date. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Project planning and research conducted</li>
            <li>Design mockups and prototypes created</li>
            <li>Code written and developed</li>
            <li>Content created and copywriting completed</li>
            <li>Any deliverables produced up to cancellation</li>
            <li>Non-recoverable expenses incurred (e.g., third-party tools, licenses, hosting)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #000000;">Cancellation Process</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Submit Notice:</strong> Send written cancellation notice to promotewithus6@gmail.com</li>
            <li><strong>Effective Date:</strong> Cancellation is effective upon receipt and acknowledgment of the notice</li>
            <li><strong>Work Cessation:</strong> We will stop work on the project immediately</li>
            <li><strong>Final Invoice:</strong> A final invoice will be prepared for work completed, minus the advance payment already received</li>
            <li><strong>Settlement:</strong> Any outstanding balance is due immediately; any overpayment will be refunded</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #000000;">Project Hold/Pause Option</h3>
        <p>If you need to pause your project temporarily instead of cancelling:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Projects can be placed on hold for up to 30 days at no additional cost</li>
            <li>After 30 days, a monthly holding fee equal to 15% of the monthly project cost will be charged</li>
            <li>To resume a held project, notify us in writing and work will recommence</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <strong>⚠️ Important Notice:</strong> Once work begins on your project, all advance payments are final and non-refundable. Please carefully review the project scope, timeline, and deliverables before committing your payment. If you have any questions about what your project includes, contact us before making payment.
        </div>

        <h2>Payment Terms & Schedule</h2>
        <p><strong>Standard Payment Structure:</strong> Most projects follow a two-phase payment structure:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Phase 1 (Advance):</strong> 50% due to commence work and secure your project slot</li>
            <li><strong>Phase 2 (Final):</strong> 50% due upon completion and before final deliverables are provided</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Alternative Payment Plans:</strong> For larger projects, we may offer customized payment schedules (e.g., 33%-33%-34% at different milestones). These will be outlined in your project agreement.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #000000;">Late Payment Consequences</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Project Suspension:</strong> If final payment is not received within 7 days of invoice date, project work may be suspended</li>
            <li><strong>Late Fees:</strong> A late payment fee of 2% per month may be charged on overdue amounts</li>
            <li><strong>Project Cancellation:</strong> If payment remains outstanding for 30 days, the project may be cancelled per our cancellation terms</li>
            <li><strong>Withholding of Deliverables:</strong> Final deliverables (website access, files, credentials) will not be released until payment is complete</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Applicable Refund Exceptions</h2>
        <p><strong>Situations where refunds may NOT be issued:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>When the client requests changes beyond the agreed scope of work (scope creep)</li>
            <li>When the client is dissatisfied with results rather than the quality of service delivered</li>
            <li>When the client cancels after work has commenced (except within the 48-hour window)</li>
            <li>When third-party services (hosting, domains, plugins) remain active after cancellation</li>
